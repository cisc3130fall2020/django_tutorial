# Extra Credit
#### Mark MacEachen

For my extra credit assigment, I choose to present a brief tutorial on building a website with Python using Django to the class. The tutorial follows along as I build an online coding portfolio for Lab 07. The tutorial is available in written format at https://github.com/cisc3130fall2020/django_tutorial

As previously discussed, I would like to present this during the final class on December 9th.

The finished product is available at: http://9c6e70591d53.ngrok.io/labs/
and the source code can be found here: https://github.com/cisc3130fall2020/lab07
